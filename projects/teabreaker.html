                Taking time for myself doesn't come naturally to me, I have to make a consious 
                decision for it. A teabreak is a tool for this. However, I noticed any time I 
                was pooring water over my teabag, the bag slipped into the cup. So 
                far for relaxing! Teabreaker solves this issue, by 'breaking' its fall.
                The design started as a quick sketch (3), which was adapted 
                into a CAD model (4). After several iterations (1, 2), 
                any cup of tea is a perfectly relaxing experience. 
                In fact, I've noticed the extra care put into 
                the beverage translates to extra care 
                for myself.
